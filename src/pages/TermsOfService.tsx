          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">3.1 Account Security</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized access to or use of your account. You are solely responsible for all activities that occur under your account, whether authorized by you or not. We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain account security.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">4. AI-Based Credit Assessment Disclaimer</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our Platform utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to evaluate loan applications and assess creditworthiness. These automated systems analyze multiple data points including but not limited to your credit history, income, employment status, transaction patterns, and other financial indicators.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">4.1 Nature of AI Assessment</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The AI-based assessment provides recommendations and preliminary evaluations to assist lending partners in their decision-making process. However, the final decision to approve or reject a loan application rests solely with our partner banks and NBFCs, which are registered and regulated by the Reserve Bank of India.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">4.2 No Guarantee of Approval</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Using our Platform and completing a loan application does not guarantee approval. Credit decisions are based on multiple factors including lender-specific policies, risk appetite, regulatory requirements, and your individual financial profile. We do not influence, control, or override lending decisions made by our partner institutions.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">4.3 Right to Review</h3>
          <p>
            If your application is rejected based on automated assessment, you have the right to request a manual review by contacting our customer support. We will work with the relevant lending partner to provide you with reasons for rejection and, where applicable, facilitate human intervention in the decision-making process.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">5.1 Application Process</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            When you submit a loan application through our Platform, we facilitate the transmission of your information to one or more lending partners. The application process involves identity verification, credit assessment, income verification, and risk evaluation.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">5.2 Conditional Approval</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            An approval indication or pre-approved offer displayed on the Platform is conditional and subject to final verification by the lending partner. The actual loan amount, interest rate, tenure, and terms may differ from the initial indication based on detailed assessment and lender policies.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">5.3 Right to Reject</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Lending partners reserve the right to reject any application at their sole discretion without providing detailed reasons. Common reasons for rejection include insufficient credit history, low credit score, high existing debt obligations, irregular income, or failure to meet lender-specific criteria.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">5.4 Credit Bureau Reporting</h3>
          <p>
            Your loan application and subsequent loan account will be reported to credit information companies. This includes information about loan disbursement, repayment history, defaults, and settlements. This reporting affects your credit score and future borrowing ability.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">6.1 Interest Rates</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Interest rates are determined by the lending partner based on your credit profile, loan amount, tenure, and prevailing market conditions. The applicable interest rate will be clearly disclosed in the loan agreement before disbursement. Interest rates may be fixed or floating as specified in your loan terms.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">6.2 Fees and Charges</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Loans may be subject to various fees including processing fees, documentation charges, prepayment penalties, late payment fees, and bounce charges. All applicable fees will be disclosed upfront in the loan agreement. No hidden charges will be levied without prior notification.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">6.3 EMI Obligations</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            You are obligated to repay the loan in equated monthly installments (EMIs) as per the agreed schedule. EMIs include both principal and interest components. You must ensure sufficient funds in your designated bank account on or before the EMI due date to avoid default and penalties.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">6.4 Consequences of Default</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Failure to repay EMIs on time constitutes default and may result in:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Late payment fees and penalty charges</li>

          <p>
            You may prepay or foreclose your loan before the end of the tenure, subject to applicable prepayment charges as specified in the loan agreement. Prepayment terms and conditions are determined by the lending partner and may vary based on loan type and tenure.
